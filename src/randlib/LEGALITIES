    We place our efforts in writing this package in the public domain.
    However, code from ACM publications is subject to the ACM policy
    (below).

                       ACM Policy on Use of Code
                       =========================
                 Here is the software Policy of the ACM.

              Submittal of an algorithm  for publication in one of the
              ACM  Transactions implies that  unrestricted use  of the
              algorithm  within  a  computer is  permissible.  General
              permission to copy  and distribute the algorithm without
              fee is granted provided that  the copies are not made or
              distributed  for direct  commercial  advantage. The  ACM
              copyright notice  and the  title of the  publication and
              its date appear, and notice  is given that copying is by
              permission    of   the    Association    for   Computing
              Machinery. To copy  otherwise, or to republish, requires
              a  fee  and/or  specific  permission. Krogh,  F.  (1997)
              ``Algorithms  Policy.''  ACM  Tran.  Math.   Softw.  13,
              183-186.

We do not know the policy  of the Royal Statistical Society; they have
discontinued  publishing algorithms.  However, they  made a  number of
these  programs available  on Statlib  on condition  that there  be no
charge for their distribution.
