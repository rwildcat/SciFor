                       README FILE FOR RANDLIB90

RANDLIB90 is a set of Fortran 90 routines that generate random numbers
from the usual statistical distributions.  The complete description of
functionality is found in the documentation files.

============================== FILES ==============================

The following files should be present when you unpack this code.

INSTALLATION: Instructions on compiling  and installing the code.  The
instructions are  necessarily vague  because almost any  computer with
any operating system could contain these programs.

-----

LEGALITIES: Describes the legalities of  use of the code.  Briefly: We
place  our  efforts  in  the  public  domain, but  much  of  the  code
originates from ACM publications.   ACM retains copyright to this code
but  allows  the  use  in  any computer  for  any  purpose.   However,
distribution for commercial gain  requires permission from the ACM and
perhaps payment.

============================== DIRECTORIES ==============================

The following directories should be present when you unpack this code.

doc: Documentation for the  package.  The source for the documentation
is    the    LaTeX     document     'randlib_doc.tex'.      Postscript
('randlib_doc.ps') was obtained  from  dvips.  The Acrobat  pdf  file,
'randlib_doc.pdf',  was   obtained  from  pdflatex.   The   text  file
(randlib_doc.txt) was obtained using HeVea.

Free Acrobat pdf readers for most computer systems can be obtained from

SOURCE:   Source  code   for   the  library.    Also  'Makefile'   and
'compile.randlib90' that may be useful in installing this code.  (See
INSTALL.)

C/C++ VERSION.   Alas, there is  none.  We have  a f77 to  C converter
which allowed  us to produce  DRANDLIB in  C, but we  have no f95  to C
converter.  (Please don't  tell us to use Sierra-Pacific's  f90 to f77
converter  and then  the f77  to C  converter.  The  odds  of anything
resembling  readable  C  code  following the  double  conversion  seem
miniscule.)   If anyone  knows of  a f95  to C  converter or  wants to
convert this code manually, we will  be glad to post the result on our
web site if the quality is adequate.
